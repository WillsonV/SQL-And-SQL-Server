#### What is the Difference Between ODBC OLEDB and JDBC

The main difference between ODBC OLEDB and JDBC is that the ODBC is an API developed by Microsoft to access relational databases 
and OLEDB is an API developed by Microsoft to access both relational and non-relational databases while JDBC is an API developed by Oracle to access the relational and non-relational database.
  
  
> When developing software, it is necessary to connect the application to the database. For example, assume a medical centre management system. The programmer has to write the code to insert, update and delete patient records, doctor records, etc. 
These systems always exchange data with a database.
ODBC, OLEDB and JDBC are three APIs that allow connecting the application to a database in order to access data.

#### What is ODBC
> ODBC stands for Open Database Connectivity. It is a standard Application Programming Interface (API) that allows accessing the DBMS using SQL.
Moreover, an application can use ODBC functions using the ODBC driver manager. The driver can pass queries to the DBMS. An application that uses ODBC is called an ODBC compliant.
Furthermore, ODBC allows maximum interoperability. In other words, a single application can access different DBMSs. 
Users can add ODBC drivers to connect the application to the required DBMS.
